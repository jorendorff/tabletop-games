# Jamprovuary - 30 days of improv

This works sort of like an advent calendar: a new surprise every day.

Each morning Small One and I will get up and turn over the card for that
day. Suppose it says "Babies" on it. We talk a little bit about how
babies behave. And then for the *rest* of the day, whenever we meet, we
have to greet each other as babies.

TODO - I want the best ones to fall on weekends and toward the end of
the month.
