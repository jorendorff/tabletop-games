Identifamy is the game where everyone tries to draw you based on the
things you say and the choices you make.

It contains a bit of Taboo (a fantastic party game), a bit of Identik
(another fantastic party game), a whole bunch of D&D, and a heaping
helping of improv.

The basic overview of the game is like this:

*   **Identifamy.** Each player secretly builds a character with ten
    traits.

*   **Bonding.** Some pairs of players establish a Bond: they reveal
    just a couple of their traits to each other and work out a back
    story together that tells how they met and how the two characters
    are tied to one another.

*   **Adventure.** There's a story that unfolds, where the characters
    work together, get to know one another, form a team, and fight
    monsters.

    The key is that the characters are all doing and saying things that
    gradually reveal their characters' traits to the other players.
    Players jot down what they learn about each other's characters
    during the game.

*   **Storytelling.** Flashbacks during the adventure let the characters
    tell stories about their past, revealing the bonds that link them
    together, giving them control of the narrative, and revealing more
    of their traits.

*   **Drawing.** Once the main adventure wraps up, and all the back
    stories have been told, each player draws an epic picture of all the
    characters together, packing every detail they've learned into the
    drawing.

    This is the big finish of the game. It's why you do your best to
    roleplay your character to the hilt. It's why you pay close
    attention to what other characters are doing and saying.

    Your skill at drawing is totally beside the point. Stick figures are
    welcome.

*   **Scoring.** Players exchange drawings and, at last, each player
    reveals all ten traits in their secret identifamy.

    Then points are awarded.

    *   You get points for other characters' traits that you portray in
        your drawing of them.

    *   You get points for role-playing when *other* players manage to
        draw *your* traits.

    *   Artistic talent scores you zero points.

Most points wins.



## Defining your identifamy

Identifamy has a gamemaster (GM) and three or more players. Each player
has a character, and each character has an *identifamy*—a set of traits
which defines them.

Your character's identifamy is made up of ten trait cards. At the start
of the game, deal out two ten-card identifamy decks to each player. Each
player looks through the two decks and chooses the one they like best,
setting the other aside for some other time.

(Note about the rejected deck: Since they've seen the whole deck, you
might want to jot that player's name on it to make sure you don't use it
later in a game where they are one of the *other* players.)

Players may customize their characters in two ways:

1.  Some cards have blanks on them, Mad Libs style, allowing the player
    to fill in whatever they want. For example, a card might read:

    ```
    pet crow             [X]

    How do you most often
    interact with it?

    ______________________

    ______________________

    ______________________
            action
    ```

    Then the player can fill in "exchange significant looks", or "mutter
    darkly to one another", or "feed her snails", or "brush her off my
    shoulder in annoyance", or "rap battles".

    One more example:

    ```
    loud laugh           [X]

    that sounds like

    "_____________________!"
        glob of letters

    and

    a toothy grin
    ```

    The player might write "RRAAAHHHAHAHA" or "OHHOHO*HO*" or
    (writing small) "*FEEEEEEE*HEHEHEhehehee".

2.  Players can ask the GM for any changes that both the player and the
    GM are OK with.

    Any trait can be changed a little or a lot, or swapped out for
    something totally different. A sword can be changed to an axe. Or a
    box of fishing tackle. Or a sweet, wrinkled face.

    Many players just won't ask for any changes. But this step is
    important. First, it gives players the opportunity to ask the GM to
    change any trait they're uncomfortable with ("hopeless romantic",
    "cusses extravagantly"). It can also let them steal a trait they're
    really really keen on from the other character they looked at. And,
    especially for experienced roleplayers, this lets them shape their
    character almost however they want.

    The GM has veto power. GMs should keep these points in mind when
    considering character changes:

    *   Good traits are drawable, roleplayable, non-disruptive,
        striking, and appealing. A bad trait can mess up the game.

    *   With a certain kind of player, you have to watch out for power
        creep.

    *   If a player looks at their two characters and decides they just
        want to play Darth Vader instead, the GM must not allow the
        player to turn their character trait by trait into Darth Vader.
        (If all the players know exactly what to draw, the point of the
        game is lost.)

(untested, from Mattie) The GM should also create an extra non-player
character with its own set of 10 traits. The GM must follow the
Show/Tell rules when playing this bonus character. This is meant to give
the GM a chance to "lead by example" a bit. At the end of the game,
players also draw the bonus character for up to 10 additional points.

The bonus character could be: someone the player characters rescue;
their boss; a party patron; support staff; a troublemaker who's always
hanging around; their adversary.

(Gamemaster's guide:) Of course the story will contain other people; you
don't need to give each one a deck of traits. Improvise and keep the
story going.


## Gathering around the table

Sit the players around a table and take note of the seating
order. Each player is *neighbors* with the next player to their left and
the next player to their right, not counting the gamemaster.

Each player therefore has two neighbors. This will be important during
Bonding.

The goal of Identifamy is to produce drawings, so have each player get a
blank sheet of paper, set it out in landscape (not portrait) in front of
them, and divide it into a number of vertical columns equal to the
number of players, again not counting the gamemaster.

Draw a horizontal line 2-3 inches from the bottom of the page. Below
this line, you'll write each character's name and notes about them.
Eventually, above the line, you'll draw them. Leave a lot more space for
the picture than the notes. (Trust us—people are taller than they are
wide, and you'll want to include their feet because some traits are
shoes.)


## Bonding

Now it's time to form Bonds between characters. Choose a pair of players
that are neighbors and take them aside to a separate room, where the
other players won't overhear.

TODO -- how this works. In short: each player reveals any two of their
trait cards, their choice, to the other player, who writes them
down. Then the two players and the GM come up with a shared back story
for these two characters based on the revealed traits.

Then repeat this process for all the other neighbor pairs.

(untested) The best kind of bond provides at least a cool origin story,
for Storytelling (below), but also creates a deep, lasting relationship
between two characters: loyalty and mutual aid; or a respectful rivalry;
a lifelong competition; a mysterious shared acquaintance; a love
triangle; maybe even undying hatred if the GM thinks they can deal with
it. But a relationship that could lead to all sorts of *other* stories
between those characters over the intervening years, so that there are
many options for Storytelling.

From experience, it's not great for a Bond to be "These characters just
met, but they've been hearing very good things about each other."

(untested) For a shorter game, it seems possible to just bond with one
other character. If the number of players is odd, the unpaired character
can have a bond with the bonus character.


## Adventuring

At last, it is time to take your band of misfits on a glorious
adventure!

*(This part is based on Matt Casper's wonderful little game, EARS, which
has brought me and my family joy for many years.)*

**About role-playing games generally.** Identifamy is a role-playing
game, like D&D. The GM comes up with some semblance of a plot, tells the
beginning of a story, and then the players act out their characters, who
say things and do things in the story, driving the action.

In general: it's the players' job to say what their character does. It's
the GM's job to say how their efforts turn out, and what all other
characters do.

The GM also introduces surprises, obstacles, and antagonists, increasing
the tension as the story progresses, and wraps up the story at the end.

**Die rolls.** When a character tries to do something and success is
uncertain, the GM will tell the player to roll a die. If the player
rolls 1, they fail; when they roll 6, they succeed. In between, it is up
to the GM to decide what happens, based on how difficult the proposed
action was. Higher numbers are better.

If one character's action is opposed by another character, both players
roll. The GM interprets the results. As before, rolling a higher number
is always better, but you don't necessarily succeed just because you
rolled a 4 and they rolled a 2. Maybe what you're trying is quite hard
("I use the robot arm to pick the guard's pocket!"), and a 2 from the
guard is a good enough effort to foil your attempt.

Except in action scenes (below), there aren't die rolls for everyday
actions like walking, talking, eating, or catching a crosstown bus.

**Keeping the action in the present.** Character actions should be
immediate. If a player tries to do something that's vague, or subsumes
too much of the remaining adventure in one step ("I'll make sure my side
wins the battle"; "I kill the dragon") the GM should ask them to be more
specific ("How are you doing that?"; "What exactly are you doing right
now?").

**Action scenes.** Sometimes the action heats up! Then the GM will make
the players take turns in order around the table. Every turn, each
player gets to try one thing and roll the die one time. Between turns,
or on their turn, the GM can roll for whatever other people in the
story—non-player characters—are trying to do.

**Revealing character.** Players never reveal their trait cards during
the adventure, but they must portray their character traits through
role-playing. (There are some rules about this; see "Rules about
revealing your character traits", below.)  Other players need to be
watching for this and taking notes! Learning your buddies' character
traits is one of the ways you score points.

Your notes turn out to be really important when a one-day adventure
later turns out to be a two-day adventure after all!

(Gamemaster's guide:) You will need to help players bring out their
traits, because they'll forget that part of the game is going on. Some
traits need a rather specific chance to shine; be as heavy-handed as you
like in bringing those opportunities about.

(Gamemaster's guide:) Quiet players may need encouragement. Don't put
pressure on people who hate it; but if you can coax every player into
exhibiting a character trait or two, everyone will be more pleased at
the end. Action scenes, at least, get everyone involved. (Everyone takes
turns.) So does Storytelling.


## Storytelling

For each pair of characters that share a Bond, at some point during the
adventure those two characters will be involved in a flashback that
tells all the players a mini-story about their past. This is called
Storytelling, because the flashback is usually framed as a conversation
happening in the present, where someone's telling a story of what
happened in the past. —But then we actually play out the past action,
like a flashback in a movie.

Sometimes the players might tell all their stories back-to-back, over a
campfire, the night before the big battle. Sometimes they'll be spread
them out over the course of the adventure.

Storytelling can be started by the players or by the GM; in practice,
the GM usually has to do it. Players start storytelling by, quite
simply, starting to tell their story, any time there's a lull in the
action and characters are talking. The GM can start storytelling by
pointing to one of the players and saying something like "That reminds
you of a time when you and Jamantha..." Then that player, or their
neighbor, picks up the thread and tells whatever tale they want to tell.

One great kind of flashback is the kind that tells the origin story,
either of the Bond the characters share, or of one or more traits. Since
Storytelling only happens for neighbors, they are guaranteed to have a
Bond. So they should have at least one story on tap, ready to tell.

The two storytellers can work together, taking turns, or one can drive
while the other throws in random details. They can roll the dice while
telling their story, like in normal play, or just talk. They can tell
their Bond story or make up a new one. It's up to them!

In fact, this is a crucial shift in control that happens in
Storytelling: the players telling the story can veto the GM, or can even
*be* the GM for their own flashback. It's their story! They don't have
to tell it exactly how it happened. They can make the whole thing up!

Either the storytellers or the GM can end the story at any time.


### Gamemaster's guide: Troubleshooting Storytelling

Have sympathy for the storyteller. As GM, you can use incremental
prompts to help shy or balky players come up with a story they want to
tell. Here's a possible series of prompts for a stuck storyteller.

*   "It was a rescue mission." (Start by drawing on the Bond: perhaps
    the two characters are veterans who fought on the same side in a
    war.)

    (Between prompts, leave a long pause, maybe 20-30 seconds, or until
    the storyteller visibly gives up or looks to you for more help.)

*   "Jamantha was really getting on your nerves that day. Why is that?"
    (Questions can help people stop stressing out and just say something.)

*   "You had rescued the prince and were heading down the tower stairs,
    and suddenly..." (Some folks do best when more details are filled in
    for them.)

*   "Maybe you heard a loud sound?" (Giving the player a chance to
    either accept your offer and yell out "Yeah! It was a troll smashing
    up the castle!" or brush it off and say something else.)

*   "Jamantha, do you remember?" (The other player can help get the ball
    rolling.)

*   "It was a stone giant attacking the tower! It starts collapsing
    around you! Roll to see if you managed to escape!" (Just hop into
    roleplaying mode and take the reins. This isn't the worst outcome!
    At least an adventure is happening.)

But sometimes it's best for the GM to just shush everyone for a good two
minutes and let the poor storyteller think.

Asking someone to go get some more chips and a Coke can be a nice way of
shushing someone.

If the story is starting to come out, but confusingly vague—vivid
details are missing—you can ask something like "Where was this?" or "And
then what did you see?"

But some people really can't stand being put on the spot in this way at
all. It's just torture for them. Identifamy gives GMs lots of tools to
try and make it easy. Since each story involves two characters that
share a bond, the game has already given them a canned story they can
probably just rattle off. The GM can prompt them to tell it. And they
have a partner to help or take over if they are feeling too
put-on-the-spot to even make a start. If they hate public speaking, but
don't mind rolling dice and yelling, the GM can get the players to start
taking turns, role-playing out the flashback. Having done that, the GM
can also help drive the action, throwing in fun obstacles and surprises.

You don't have to use incremental prompts—if you know the player, you
can jump straight to whatever you think will be fun for them.

(untested) Once a flashback is over, the GM can choose to let something
from the flashback come back into the present: for example, if in the
flashback the characters found a small box containing lightning, the GM
can say "And the proof is in your backpack—you're still carrying the
lightning box, to this very day." The GM should do this because it's
positively delicious, but try not to let the players abuse it.

Sometimes it's obvious when a story is over. If not, it's the GM's job
to wrap it up. It's usually fine to end a story, no matter what's going
on, as soon as it's not fun anymore. Don't wait for a "good stopping
point". You can wave your hands and add a sentence summarizing the
rest. Or the story could be interrupted by something exciting happening
in the present.

TODO: Consider a time limit on storytelling.


## Rules about revealing your character traits

To win at Identifamy, you need to reveal your character traits to the
other players. But you can't just read off all ten cards in a loud, clear
voice, and win the game. There are rules.

The first thing you need to know: setting aside Bonding, there are
fundamentally two ways to reveal your character: Tell and Show.

As we will see later, the rules strictly limit Telling, but not Showing.

*   **Tell.** You simply tell the other players something about your
    character. ("Lobelia is wearing a Stormtrooper uniform.")

    Or, during the game, your character tells the other characters about
    the trait. (you, as Lobelia: "It's OK, fellas—I have a ship at the
    spaceport, ready to lift off. But it'll cost ya.")

    TODO: Consider adding a rule that any time you do a Tell, it costs
    you a point. It'd probably still be worthwhile to do a bunch of
    Tells for physical traits, get them out of the way right at the
    beginning and help other players picture you in their
    minds. However, enforcing the rule would make it really obvious when
    someone has done a Tell, and the uncertainty is kind of important
    too.

    Tells are an easy way to give out information, but there are some
    rules that limit when you're allowed to do a Tell.

*   **Show.** You show by your actions and choices what you're made of.

    Or, you manage to somehow get the GM to reveal the trait for you!
    This is rare, but GMs are willing to help out sometimes. We'll see
    an example later.

    Showing is harder than telling. But if you think about it, you can
    Show almost anything. The following things count as Showing:

    1.  *Actions.* Suppose you have the trait "goes into danger to
        protect the weak". To Show this action, all you have to do is
        take every opportunity to rush into burning buildings, storm
        enemy lines, jump out of perfectly good flying machines, and so
        forth in attempts to protect children, puppies, and prime
        ministers.

        Sometimes an action reveals your trait a bit more directly.
        That's usually OK. For example, suppose you have a pet
        mouse. During the adventure, you find a little cake labeled "EAT
        ME". On your turn, you can say "I feed my pet mouse some of the
        cake". Even though "pet mouse" might be the exact words on your
        trait card, this counts as an action, not talking, so it counts
        as a Show, not a Tell.

    2.  *Role-playing.* Some traits are things you can Show at the
        table. You can Show that your character has a "toothy grin" by
        grinning toothily, that they're "wide-eyed" by opening your eyes
        wide, that they're "enthusiastic" by nodding your head
        enthusiastically and waving your arms, that they have a
        "Scottish accent" by talking with a Scottish accent, and so on.

    And, as a special exception to the rules:

    3.  *Contingency.* During the adventure, if you and your team are
        making plans or in trouble, and you have a card that would fit
        particularly well into those plans or resolve the trouble, you
        can ask the GM for permission to have your character tell the
        others about the trait, and have it count as a Show, rather than
        a Tell. The GM will OK this only if:

        *   it would be ridiculous for your character to keep quiet
            about this trait in this circumstance; *and*

        *   it's not practical in-game to do a proper Show. A good Show
            is always preferred; if it seems possible here, the GM will
            just say "Show them instead."

All right. With that out of the way, here are the rules.

*   Except for Bonding, you must keep your cards secret, all the way
    through the game until Scoring. You never "play" your cards face-up
    on the table.

*   You can Show all of your traits as many times as you like throughout
    the game.

*   Each trait card has checkboxes `[ ]` in the upper right corner to
    indicate how many times you are allowed to Tell that trait.

    If you see two checkboxes, you can Tell that trait up to 2 times. If
    there's just one checkbox, you can Tell it once. Check the boxes as
    you go.

    If you see `[X]` instead, it means *SHOW, DON'T TELL*. You can't
    Tell this trait. You are still allowed to Show it as often as you
    like.

*   Whenever you reveal one of your character's traits, whether you use
    a Show or a Tell, you must work it into the story at an appropriate
    time.

    For example, if your character wears bright green lipstick, and she
    calls another character on the phone, don't blurt out,

    > "I'm wearing green lipstick, by the way."

    This is a Tell, but it's against the rules because people don't
    really talk like that on the phone!

    Instead, the first time you meet you can do a much better Tell:

    > So, the real striking thing you notice about Helene is her bright
    > green lipstick.

    And if you happen to think of it, you can add:

    > It draws attention to her mouth. Which turns down at the corners,
    > like she's sneering at you. Then you look up at her eyes, and
    > yeah, she is looking right at you and sneering.

    Now you're using one trait to hint at another. You're Showing that this
    character might be snide and sarcastic, or have a chip on her shoulder,
    or tend to dislike people on first sight.

    What if you wanted to use a Show to reveal that your character wears
    green lipstick? This is quite hard unless you happen to have a green
    lipstick handy. But you might try this:

    > I kiss the guard on the cheek.

    If you're super lucky, the GM will say something like, "OK, you kiss
    him. Your lipstick leaves a bright green kiss mark on his cheek."

Showing cards to your neighbors during Bonding at the start of the game
doesn't count as either a Show or a Tell. You're allowed to reveal cards
that have an `[X]` on them during Bonding.


## Drawing

The players draw each others' characters, including all the details they
learned from the game.

Players don't have to draw their own character.

TODO

(is there a time limit?)

Speech bubbles and sound effects are OK.


## Scoring

Choose one player to reveal their character first. The other players
need to exchange drawings so that no one is judging their own drawing.

One by one, the player reveals their character's trait cards.

For each character trait of one player that *another* player's
drawing portrays in any way, both those players—the one who played
the character *and* the one who drew the picture—get a point.

Judge *very* leniently. Award the point if you possibly can, even if
only part of the trait is shown. There will still be borderline cases;
use your judgment or ask the other players what they think.

*   If the trait to be scored is "large warhammer", and the
    picture shows a smallish warhammer, award the point.

    If it shows a large carpenter's hammer instead, award the point.

    If it shows the character holding a large letter T, award the point.

    If it clearly shows a large battle-axe, probably don't award the
    point.

*   If the trait is "plump, wears flowing dresses", award the point if
    *either* half is shown. If the picture shows a stick figure in a sort
    of dress, award the point.

    If it shows a roundish person but no clothes are discernable, award
    the point.

    If it shows a curvy person in skin-tight clothes, award the point.

*   Players must get no points for artistic ability. If the trait is
    "hopeless romantic", and the picture shows a stick figure holding a
    daisy, give them the point. Not everyone can draw a rose.

Once every player has revealed all their traits, tally up the points.
Most points wins! There's no tie-breaker; ties are joint victories.

Suppose you're in a game with four characters. You're playing one of the
characters, so there are three others. In theory, you can get up to 30
points from drawing them. And you can get up to 30 points for having
role-played your traits properly, so the others draw good pictures of
you. That makes a maximum score of 60. If there's a bonus character, you
can get up to 70. (In practice, it's hard. A total score of (untested)
35 is typically game-winning.)

## Gamemaster's guide: Designing traits

The reason Identifamy has pre-generated characters is that it is
honestly hard to come up with good traits. For the game to work at all,
traits have to be both drawable and roleplayable, and they must not
disrupt the game too much. But that's not all: traits also have to be
appealing, memorable, lovable, and ideally useful in-game—in a word,
fun.

So designing traits for Identifamy is game design. Good traits can fall
into these categories:

*   Stuff about you that's super easy to see and hear:

    *   Physical facts about how you look: your body, face, hair
        ("short, round body"; "dark lipstick"; "fat face, mutton chops";
        "long, black hair"; "hobbit-sized"; "tall, thin"; "7 feet tall,
        muscular"; "shaved head with ponytail"; "bushy mustache")

    *   Physical behavioral traits: how you hold yourself, the way you walk,
        facial expressions ("wide-eyed, enthusiastic"; "acrobatic")

    *   Your voice and verbal habits ("thunderous, arresting voice";
        "Australian accent"; "talks like the pig in *Toy Story*"; "often
        says 'possibly, possibly'")

*   Items:

    *   Clothes, shoes, and armor ("bowler hat, fancy suit"; "goes
        barefoot")

    *   Weapons ("longbow & arrows"; "saber"; "huge warhammer"; "pocket
        crossbow") (card typically implies or expressly confers
        proficiency in using the weapon)

    *   Magic items ("magic key that opens many locks"; "magic monocle";
        "magically resizable longboat with oars")

    *   Tools ("huge goggles"; "brass telescope")

    *   Weird junk, trinkets, musical instruments ("wears a rusty
        sheriff star")

    *   Especially: a **carryall**, something you can carry all your stuff
        in ("large sea-chest"; "walking cauldron"; "huge backpack";
        "shoulder bag of necessaries"; "tan duffel bag")

    *   Sundries, necessaries, household items, food. These aren't
        important from the perspective of a character's identity, but
        during the game it's often handy to have a bit of rope or
        what-have-you. So instead of being its own trait, this stuff can
        be thrown in as a few bullet points on the "carryall" card.

*   Personality and demeanor ("often confused, but cheerful"; "makes fun
    of others"; "prayerful"; "proud, serious"; "competitive, cocky";
    "has a friendly word for everyone"; "hopeless romantic")

*   Values ("goes into danger to protect the weak"; "likes to deliver a
    'knockout punch' (decisive action)")

    Hard to draw. Make sure it's at least possible in theory to draw
    yours.

*   Background ("was an Army captain")

*   Pets, dependents, servants ("pet crow"; "pet mouse"; "hired valet")

*   Habits, characteristic actions, compulsive behaviors, things you
    like, things you like to do ("always trying to get people to eat a
    'sand-wich'"; "calls on Hecate to curse people"; "habit of clearing
    his throat and saying his catchphrase"; "loves clocks and
    tinkering"; "loves fish donuts"; "loves eating meat"; "must have tea
    at 3 PM sharp"; "loves climbing and swinging from ropes"; "loves
    singing and dancing"; "drinks beer (lots)"; "plays cards"; "drinks
    coffee")

    Easy to role-play, not always so easy to draw.

    Often a "thing you like" (eating meat) can be drawn just by putting
    the associated physical thing in the picture (you're holding a giant
    turkey leg).

    Flaws or anti-traits are hard to draw and mostly to be avoided, but
    I tried a couple: "always losing her book"; "annoyed by kids".

*   Skills and abilities, job, profession, training ("can pick pockets",
    "can control light/darkness"; "can 'brew up' any object in your
    magic cauldron, given a few hours"; "knows how to use Icarus wings";
    "very good at lying, bluffing, and fooling people"; "champion
    boxer"; "officer in the Revolutionary Army"; "trained in magic
    cannon"; "knows all about boats and sailing"; "fast-talker"; "great
    with horses"; "expert fiddle player")

    There's not much difference between "things you like to do" and
    "abilities".

    A job can almost always be illustrated because jobs have associated
    uniforms and tools.

    Your pets or servants can have abilities too: "Your valet is a
    deadly fighter and a good cook".

*   Some traits combine a couple of the above categories. For example:

    *   "loud laugh, toothy grin" = voice + facial expression
    *   "plump, wears flowing dresses" = physical appearance + dress
    *   "usually holding a knife" = item: weapon + habit
    *   "capacious magical overcoat" = clothes + carryall
    *   "clipped British accent, proper at all times" = voice + demeanor

    Note that all of these traits also tell you (or hint at) something
    about the character's personality that can be role-played.

    Since we score the final drawings very generously, only one part of
    the trait needs to be drawable.

It is part of the game for some cards to be gimmes and others to be
quite hard to role-play. Therefore it's OK to take a real tough
role-playing challenge and give it no Tells (`[X]`).

Likewise, it's part of the game for some traits to be easy to draw and
some to be hard.


## Designing characters

Do your own thing, of course, but I mainly did it like this.

I tried to come up with a character concept and personality first, then
turn them into a deck.

Every character should have:

*   1-2 body/hair traits that are easy to draw. Usually give two Tells
    for these.

*   1 more of the same, but clothes.

*   0-1 voice/verbal trait. No Tells.

    (I need to experiment. My players had fun with catchphrases, shied
    away from accents. I didn't try "low, raspy, monotone voice",
    "munchkin voice", "voice like a squeaky door". But note that verbal
    traits are drawable as speech bubbles, and the others basically
    aren't at all.)

*   1 attitude/personality trait that's very easy to role-play. No Tells.

*   0-1 attitude/personality trait that's a little harder to role-play
    or draw. Also no Tells, to force the player to role-play it.

*   1 job that's easy to draw; probably no Tells.

*   1-2 skill/ability, useful in-game; probably no Tells.

*   1 carryall (usually 1 or 2 Tells).

*   1 weapon or fight-relevant ability (if it's that sort of story).
    Tells if it's a visible weapon.

*   2 lottery tickets: not-obviously-useful habits/tics/likes/abilities
    such as "loves fish donuts" or "expert fiddle player" that round out
    the character but may never matter. Tells optional; remember, the
    players can always bring these out in Storytelling.

That may add up to 12 or so. Combine traits to make it all fit.

At the last minute, check and make sure there's a good mix of
easy/hard-to-roleplay and easy/hard-to-draw traits.
