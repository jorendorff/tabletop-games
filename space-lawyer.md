# Space Lawyer: A role-playing party game of powerful alien artifacts, time-traveling lizard people, and murder most foul
for 3 or more players

Ingredients:
*   the Space Lawyer deck
*   the Defense deck
*   the Jury deck
*   a ~~time machine~~ timer


## Quick start

Each round of Space Lawyer is a murder trial lasting about 15 minutes.
At the beginning of each round, here's what you need to do.

*   Pick one player to be the **Judge**,
    one to be the **Defense**, and one to be the **Prosecutor**.
    The Defense and the Prosecutor are the Space Lawyers.

    If there are extra players, they'll be the **Jury** and **Witnesses**;
    if not, the Judge does these jobs too.

*   Deal each Space Lawyer seven cards from the Space Lawyer deck.

*   Deal the Defense three cards from the Defense deck.

*   Deal each member of the Jury one card from the Jury deck, face-up.

Before the trial can begin, the players need to figure out a few more bits of information.

*   The Judge tells the Space Lawyers how it wants to be addressed.
    For your first game, just use "Judge" or "Your Honor".

*   The Defense announces the defendant's name.
    (The *defendant* is the person who stands accused of murder.
    It typically have no role in the trial, although it can be called as a witness.)

*   The Prosecutor chooses the victim's name and the cause of death.

When that's done, set a timer for four minutes, and court is in session.


## What Space Lawyer is like

Every trial follows the same schedule.

*   First phase - 4 minutes. The Prosecutor starts this phase by making an
    accusation.  Both Space Lawyers make arguments, present Evidence,
    and call Witnesses.

*   Second phase - 4 minutes. The Defense starts this phase by playing a
    Defense card. Otherwise it's just like the first phase.

*   Closing arguments - 30 seconds each.

*   Jury deliberation - 1 minute.

*   Finally, the Jury renders a verdict, deciding the case.

The two Space Lawyers informally take turns
making short arguments for the defendant's guilt or innocence,
playing Evidence cards to back up what they say.

The trial proceeds like the '80s TV show "Night Court".
Nobody is very prepared. It's informal and we're rolling with the punches.

Like this:

> **Prosecutor:** Your Bleakness, in the matter of *Lifeforms v. Logor
> Smanesh,* the victim is one Lord Moneypants, found dead and frozen
> solid in a meat locker.
>
> **Defense:** Your Bleakness, this prosecution is a travesty.
> My client is a fire demon. He couldn't possibly have been in the meat locker.
> The cold would have killed him.
>
> **Judge** *(to Prosecutor):* Is this true?
>
> **Prosecutor:** Yes, Your Bleakness, but Mr. Smanesh locked the victim
> in from outside. He left a huge burn spot on the floor just outside the door
> *(plays the "Burnt spot" Evidence card, drawing one to replace it).*
>
> **Defense:** Your Honor, that burn spot could have been put there by— by—
>
> **Judge** *(coldly):* You may address me as "Your Bleakness", Earthling.
>
> **Defense:** Yes, Your Bleakness. I mean, the burn spot could have been...
> Mega Dragons.
>
> **Prosecutor:** That's pretty thin. Our tachyon refrect-a-meter
> detected traces of Satanic residue that's only left by fire demons of
> Mr. Smanesh's kind *(plays the "Tachyon refractometer" Evidence card,
> drawing one to replace it).*

Phew! Not looking good for the Defense. Hopefully he's got some Evidence
of his own.

Each Space Lawyer should always have seven cards in hand.
Whenever you play a card, draw a card to replace it.


## The rules

The key rules of Space Lawyer are the Rules of Canon:

1.  **Space Lawyers may not contradict a statement that is Canon
    except by uncovering new Evidence or Witness testimony.**

2.  **Any statement of fact backed by an Evidence card or Witness testimony is Canon.**

3.  **Any statement of fact made by either Space Lawyer is *mostly* Canon.**
    Once a fact is mentioned, Space Laywers can't just ignore it—they
    have to at least come up with some plausible reason
    for the opposing Space Lawyer to have lied or been mistaken,
    if they want to change it.

This is the part of the game that tells what you can and can't argue in
Space Court, and prevents the game from dissolving into "Is not!" "Is too!"
which would be way too realistic.

Some examples:

*   After the Defense said that his client was a fire demon, it would
    *not* have been OK for the Prosecutor to respond with

    > **Prosecutor:** He's a fire demon, and I'm Regis Philbin. Look at
    > him! He's a five-foot-two parrot salesman from Guernsey!

    Nope! What the Defense said about the fire demon is Canon.
    The Prosecutor has to roll with it
    (unless it has a LIES! or Technicality card—we'll get to those later on).

*   Appealing to the Judge with some kind of clever or funny line may or
    may not warrant a minor exception to the Rules of Canon:

    > **Prosecutor:** *Alleged* fire demon, Your Bleakness. The Defense
    > hasn't presented any evidence of this except the defendant's
    > "smoldering good looks". *(rolls eyes)*
    >
    > **Judge** *(having none of it):* The defendant is clearly a fire
    > demon, Counselor. Let's move on.

    Not funny enough, apparently. Oh well. You win some, you lose some.

*   After the Prosecutor played the "Burnt spot" card, it would *not* have
    been OK for the Defense to respond that "it was a minor charcoal
    spill, Your Bleakness".

**Defense cards are not Canon.**
And if the defendant is called as a Witness, its testimony isn't Canon either.
(That is, just because a defendant claims to be innocent doesn't make it so.)

**It's up to the Judge** how far Space Lawyers can bend the Rules of Canon.
But Space Lawyerin' is all about working the facts, not rewriting them.


### Witnesses

If you are called as a Witness, your job is to testify in the case.

Most of the cards in the Space Lawyer deck are Evidence cards,
but there are also Witness cards.
Either Space Lawyer can call a Witness whenever it's its turn to talk,
just by playing a Witness card from its
hand face-up in front of any of the Witness players.
The Witness is instantly considered "sworn in". You're on!

The Witness card tells you a bit about the character you're going to play.
For example:

> **Badrox**
> *   space biker
> *   from hell
> *   can't lie

The Space Lawyers will ask you questions about the case.
Just role-play to the best of your ability.

> **Defense:** Your Bleakness, the defense calls Badrox the space
> biker. *(plays the "Badrox" Witness card, then draws one to replace
> it)* Badrox, where were you on the night of the murder?
>
> **Badrox:** Well now that was a Saturday night, so I woulda been
> cussin', and fightin', and drinkin', and me and Charlie probably rode
> on out to the Black Hole.
>
> **Defense:** And did you see a supernova anywhere in the vicinity?
>
> **Badrox:** Nope. I don't see how we coulda missed it, neither, seein'
> as that kinda thing woulda wiped out all life for about forty light
> years every direction. I been through a couple. Ain't pretty.
>
> **Defense:** Thank you.

You should answer questions however seems most entertaining, keeping in
mind that Witnesses called by the Defense should generally offer
testimony that's favorable to the Defense, and the Prosecutor's
Witnesses should generally testify in favor of the Prosecution.
(They called you to testify for a reason, right?
Presumably you have something to say that favors their side.)

The Space Lawyers do not formally take turns examining Witnesses.
Instead, either Space Lawyer may direct questions to any Witness at any time.
Witnesses stay "sworn in" for the rest of the trial.

A player may end up playing the role of multiple Witnesses. Enjoy!

**Calling the defendant.** The Defense may call the defendant to the stand to
testify in its own defense! This doesn't require a Witness card. Note
that a Witness player (not the Defense) must role-play the defendant.

The defendant's testimony is weakly Canon—other Witnesses and Evidence
may contradict it.

The Prosecution may not call the defendant, but once the defendant is a
Witness, the Prosecution may ask questions.


### LIES! and Technicalities

Mixed into the Space Lawyer deck are a few cards that just say "LIES!" on
them.

As either Space Lawyer, if you've got one of these, you can play it
whenever another player says something particularly damaging to your
case—even if it's backed by Evidence or Witness testimony. You have
to interrupt whatever's going on and play your LIES! card *right away,*
and explain exactly how or why whatever was just said is a shocking,
unconscionable, immoral, inaccurate statement of pure evil. Your heroic
takedown becomes Canon in place of the lie.

You can't use LIES! to refute a statement from a Witness who "can't
lie".

Also mixed into the Evidence deck are some cards that say
"Technicality". These are like LIES! cards, except you use them to
render a statement or a piece of Evidence inadmissable. Again, you must
interrupt whatever's going on and spout some ridiculous legal reason
that whatever was just said is not admissable in court. The statement or
Evidence is stricken from the Jury's memory using a massive
electromagnet. You can use a Technicality even on a statement by a
Witness who "can't lie". However, a Technicality doesn't let you
substitute your own facts.

You *can* use a LIES! or Technicality card on the opposing Space
Lawyer's explanation of *its* LIES! or Technicality card. (But if it
gets complicated, don't come crying to us. You're the one with a J.D. in
Space Law. You sort it out.)


### If you are the Prosecutor,

...your goal is to get the defendant convicted of murder in the first
degree and reduced to plasma by the Space Justice Department, Division
of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Pretty straightforward.

Your first responsibility is to start the game. *Before the timer starts,*
you need to figure out what your opening line will be.
You must include these three things:

*   the defendant's name (chosen by the Defense)

*   the victim's name

*   how the victim was found (stabbed, poisoned, roasted, atomized,
    squangled, glitched, whatever)

Remember how the example above started?

> **Prosecutor:** Your Bleakness, in the matter of *Lifeforms v. Logor
> Smanesh,* the victim is one Lord Moneypants, found dead and frozen
> solid in a meat locker.

Let's see: 1) The defendant is Logor Smanesh; 2) the victim is Lord Moneypants; 3)
Moneypants apparently froze to death. Perfect.

Here's another example:

> **Prosecutor:** Judge, our next case is *Lifeforms v. Melodia
> Smith 47193.*  The victim is one Mr. Meow, who was found smushed under
> Ms. Smith 47193's space yacht.

From that point forward, you just do the Space Lawyer thing, playing
Evidence cards and calling Witnesses. You need to establish that the
defendant had motive, means, and opportunity to commit the crime.

Just kidding. All you need to do is convince the Jury. More on that
later.


### If you are the Defense,

...you're trying to get the defendant (your client) set free.

Look at your three Defense cards. You'll need to use one of these; you
can't win a case without using a Defense card.

To use your Defense card, just state your client's defense and place the
card face-up on the table.

The Defense card is phrased as something your client has said to you.
You may want to say it a little differently for the court. For example,
if the card says:

> Time travelers did it.

then you might start out like this:

> **Defense:** Your Honor, my client is clearly the victim of a
> conspiracy that stretches across time itself *(plays the "Time
> travelers did it" Defense card)*, and I'll prove it. I present this
> ABBA album that was found at the scene of the crime...

The Rules of Canon apply *weakly* to Defense cards. You'll have to
shore up your Defense with Evidence and Witnesses. The Prosecutor will
seek to attack it with Evidence and Witnesses of its own.

The trial happens in two four-minute phases. You kick off the second
phase by playing your chosen Defense card.

If your Defense gets totally trashed in court, you may play a second
Defense card (at any time) and try to switch to that. It's a pretty
bold move though. Why should anyone believe you the second time?

Not all of the Defenses look like they will stand up in court, but
that's why we have Space Lawyers. Put the best possible face on
it. That's the job.


### If you are the Judge,

...your job is to keep order. What you say goes; you have absolute
authority in your courtroom. Here are the rules you need to enforce:

1.  *Proper respect.* Before the timer starts, tell the Space Lawyers
    how to address you. This could be "Judge" or "Your Honor" or "O
    Mighty Gleethrax". The Space Lawyers must use your preferred form of
    address.

2.  *Equal time.* Make sure both Space Lawyers get a chance to talk. They
    should be taking turns almost every other sentence.

    When one Space Lawyer makes a point, turn to the other and say,
    "Is this true?" (to which the other Space Lawyer typically has to
    say, "Yes, O Mighty Gleethrax, but...")

3.  *The Rules of Canon.* Each Space Lawyer *must* accept "facts" presented
    by the other side if they're backed by any Evidence, and the
    testimony of Witnesses who "can't lie". Of course everything is open
    to interpretation.

    Space Laywers must also *mostly* accept testimony of normal
    Witnesses and facts presented without Evidence.

    As Judge, it's your job to interrupt a wayward Space Lawyer and
    reassert the previously established Canon:

    > **Defense:** This radioactive meat sauce *(plays the "meat sauce"
    > Evidence card, drawing a card to replace it)* was found at the scene.
    > It could have caused the tachyons.
    >
    > **Prosecutor:** Well actually the meat sauce wasn't found *at*
    > the scene of the crime—
    >
    > **Judge:** I'm sorry, didn't we just establish that it was found
    > at the scene?
    >
    > **Defense:** Yes, O Mighty Gleethrax.
    >
    > **Prosecutor:** Uh... sorry, O Mightly Gleethrax, what I meant to
    > say was, the meat sauce was... um... well, let's hear what an
    > expert has to say about this evidence! *(plays the "Dr. Memeface"
    > Witness card, drawing a card to replace it)*

    The Judge should grow increasingly hostile to Space Laywers who try
    to plow over inconvenient Canon.

    The Technicality and LIES! cards are exceptions to this rule.

4.  *Keep an eye on the clock* and make sure things wrap up on time.
    (Refer back to the "Trial schedule" section.)

Whew—that's a lot of work! But with great responsibility comes great power.
Here are the punishments you may bring to bear on misbehaving Space Lawyers:

*   You may require a Space Lawyer to play with one hand touching its nose
    at all times.

*   You may require a Space Laywer to stand on one foot.

*   You may require a Space Lawyer to talk like Daffy Duck.
    (Important note: Not Donald Duck. That would be ridiculous.)

*   You may have a particularly obnoxious Space Lawyer thrown into the Pit
    of the Xorlorn, in which case it loses the case by default, as well
    as its various organs and souls.

    (It's OK, new organs and souls typically ship within 72 hours.
    Of course replacement souls are not much like the genuine article,
    but when you're a Space Lawyer, you don't worry about these things.)

All of these punishments should be used very, very sparingly. It's good
sense and good courtroom drama to look over the rims of your glasses and
drawl "You're treading on thin ice, Counselor!" or something as a last
warning before pulling the trigger.

If a Space Lawyer manages to get thrown to the Xorlorn, it is to be
considered a badge of honor that the Space Lawyer will carry forward
through all its future lifetimes. A round of applause is customary on
such an occasion.


### Points of law (and other Space Lawyer-y stuff)

One weird thing that can happen is that a case might actually hinge on
some point of law. Imagine!

> **Defense:** Judge, I'm just a simple country Space Lawyer, but I
> don't see how my client can be held responsible for the actions of his
> severed arm.
>
> **Prosecutor:** Judge, in *Lifeforms v. Cheney*, a disembodied head
> was found guilty of throwing fireballs at—
>
> **Defense:** Well, sure, a *head!*
>
> **Prosecutor:** And, in *Lifeforms v. Nucleobard*, the defendant's
> wiggling fingers were found guilty of button-pushing even though they
> weren't attached to any hands at the time.
>
> **Defense:** That's totally different. Nucleobard didn't *have* a
> head!

It's the Judge's job to settle these questions in whatever way seems
best. The Judge is encouraged to choose based on humor and gameplay
value over common sense. It is the law, after all.

> **Judge:** I'll allow this prosecution to go forward. But you have to
> prove defendant's intent to kill prior to the lopping accident and the
> whole thing with the ghost.
>
> **Prosecutor:** Yes, Judge.

Also, Space Lawyers love to yell "Objection!" and all kinds of other
nonsense they heard on TV one time. This is the entire point of the
game. Take sides. Egg them on!


### Closing Arguments

After the second 4-minute timer goes off,
each Space Lawyer gets to make a thirty-second Closing Argument.
This is your last chance to sway the jury.
The rules are different from the rest of the trial:

*   Cards can't be played during Closing Arguments.
    Witnesses can't be consulted.
    A Closing Argument is just a Space Lawyer talking directly to the jury.

*   A Space Lawyer can't talk or make noise during the other Space
    Lawyer's Closing Argument.

*   Closing Arguments *are not subject to the Rules of Canon.*  They may
    be a tissue of lies that contradicts everything that came before.
    Or you can present a cogent summary of the evidence behind your case.
    Good luck either way!


### Decision

After Closing Arguments, each Juror looks at its Juror card and decides
how that Juror would vote on the case. Jurors are not necessarily
impartial; every Juror has its own biases (listed on the cards).

For example, a Juror card might have a picture of a giant bug and the
text "cares about: insectoid rights". If the Defense presents the
defendant as an innocent insectoid being framed by mammalian cops, this
Juror might be especially receptive to that argument, especially if any
of the Prosecutor's witnesses are caught in LIES!

But all Jurors are trying to guess at the truth, and can be swayed by
Witnesses and Evidence—if they believe them.

*The Rules of Canon do not apply to the Jury's brains.* Space Jurors are
free to believe or refuse to believe whatever they want.

Space Juries don't have to convict unanimously. That's a weird Human
thing. (We also don't bother asking Jurors "Do you think you can be
fair?"  Seriously, where do you get this stuff.) In Space, whichever
side gets the most votes wins. Ties go to the Defense.


### Beyond

For the next round, each player switches to a different role and the
whole thing starts over. Once everyone has played each role once, the
player with the most victories is named Space Lawyer of the Eon—a real
accomplishment. It might want to consider a run for Space Governor.
That's a whole other game. But it's never too early to start laying the
groundwork.

## Space Lawyering Equipment

### Defense deck

My hive-brother did it.

I had brain parasites. It got better. Could happen to anybody!

I've been framed. The witnesses are all cryptids disguised as people.

I couldn't have committed the crime because I didn't exist. I was cloned fresh on Thursday.

This court has no jurisdiction because the killing happened inside an event horizon.

Everyone else in the universe is guilty EXCEPT me!

My DNA was planted on the scene by giant mosquitos.

Time was reversed. I thought I was unstabbing the victim back to life.

This so-called "crime" is just a natural part of the "victim"'s unusual reproductive cycle.

This universe is not the real universe! And if you can only get me a 9.7 exawatt giggacrystal, I'll prove it!

On Wagoo IV, crime is meaningless, because on that planet all possibilities occur simultaneously.

Time travelers did it.

I couldn't have committed the crime. I was dormant in the death-vaults of Thanator IX.

My people are the willing servants of mightly Gleethrax! We all did it!

The crime would have been committed in the Subjunctive Mode. Any victims were strictly hypothetical.

I misunderstood the victim's anatomy. I thought we were just ... wrestling.

The victim was chosen as the vector for a Death Seed that would have killed billions.

I didn't do it—it was my Other Self—HER mole is on the RIGHT!

I should not be punished for this crime because you can't prove I did it.

I am a superior being and this was all a test. You passed! Your species will be spared.

The victim was secretly Space Czar, sentenced to death in a million systems for crimes against bioticy.

This "murder" was a spectacularly clever revenge-suicide frame job.

An implanted ego did it, using my body, while I was asleep!

My own Space Lawyer did the crime, then framed me for it! Great Space, why?! Why did you do it?!!

The victim's own organs rearranged themselves into me voluntarily.

I only extinguished all bio-activity of the victim to save on entropy.

It was a non-sentient Bean Person.

This is ridiculous. Even my own memory of the event is inaccessible, due to Chrono-censorship blacking out the time of the crime! How am I supposed to defend myself?

My brain was swapped into this body after the murder.

I couldn't have done it! Look at me, I'm a giant snail!

I was trying to save the victim's life—dammit, I'm a Space Doctor! Its hearts weren't where I expected, that's all.

It was self defense. The victim was about to go nova!

My symbiote did it.

I can't be guilty of *any* crime. My sense of right and wrong was punched out by a tachyon pulse.

As a Mantis Woman, it is my legal right to kill and/or devour a man after sex.

I was a Galactic Agent (though of course the Agency disavows me now). The "victim" was a terrorist assassin.
