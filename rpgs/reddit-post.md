## About bond cards

Goals: •make rich characters •give the players themselves plenty of ideas for stories about their characters •do it fast

Idea: Present 2 or 3 of the cards below to a pair of neighboring players. They choose one, fill in the blanks in the story, and make sure they have answers to these four questions:

1.  How did it start?
2.  What was it like?
3.  How did it end?
4.  How do you feel about each other now?

Jot down the answers on the card. It becomes part of both characters.

"(foo / bar / baz)" indicates checkboxes, and "*[choose job: woodcutter]*" indicates a Mad-Libs-style fill-in-the-blank, with "woodcutter" pencilled in as an example.
