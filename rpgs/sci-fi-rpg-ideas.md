# Sci-fi role-playing game ideas

## "Pass"

One player, one DM. Survive as a human in a society of robots.

Robots are designed to resemble people down to the atoms, and (since
there are no humans) they are generally pretty trusting. A series of
tense one-on-one encounters. Roll on a table of human needs and a table
of suspicious robots to determine what happens next. The plot either
progresses up Maslow's hierarchy (needs become more humanistic: sunlight
as opposed to medicine) or descends into desperation.


## "Cipher"

Base rules: like Among Us. Everyone gets a set of cards that include
things like "Eject Blue", "Kill Blue". One of you is the imposter, but
nobody knows which. Very weakly "encoded" messages represent your slowly
returning memories; each turn everyone gets one to decode. Messages can
also contain extra rules (e.g. an Escape Capsule message; a Secret
Orders message). Will need difficulty levels, or at least wildly
differing puzzle difficulty, so everyone can enjoy.

Codes will be on the order of "swap all S with T", or "rotate all
vowels", or "all letters in the span E-M have been replaced with the
corresponding digit 1-9", or "the letters in every word are reversed";
sometimes all the words will have been run together, etc. The idea is
you do need to crack them, but then it's pretty easy to read out the
rest. Can write a program to generate these.

Maybe all messages are randomly rolled on a d100 table, so the game is
really procedurally generated.


## "Velvet"

(or some name of a very black fabric)

Alternates between (A) stealth ship-to-ship combat and (B) role-played
on-planet intrigue encounters. The two phases interact; a bad combat can
mean you have to beg for help on-planet. Resources: gold (¥), cargo (♣),
combat wins (★), ship health (♥).  Ship stats: weapons, armor, accel.

Start with 5♥, 0★, 2♣, 1¥.

**Travel** — Space travel happens in a 10×10×10 grid (like Battleships
but in 3D). When Travel phase starts, roll your location and the location
of your objective randomly using 3d10. Your goal is to reach the
objective without being detected. Each turn you must move 1 unit along
one of the three axes, to one of the 6 adjacent grid cubes.  Then choose
a cell to probe. The location you probe must be on one of the 26 rays
emanating from your new location, along the three axes or diagonally. If
a probe hits an enemy ship, that ship loses 1♥.

A randomly generated Hegemony patrol ship is doing the same thing,
trying to find you. We can tweak the probabilities to make combat work;
and add encounters in space, where e.g. you take on some risk to salvage
a derelict ship or answer a distress call.

Another possible design is that you don't take damage in Travel phase,
but if an enemy ship finds you, and they can get in close, they can
engage you in "combat" which is another phase of play. Combat happens in
rounds.  Choose a number 1-4. Enemy chooses a letter A-D. Reveal choices
simultaneously. Result is then looked up in a 4×4 table; many entries
are icons for a ship stat, indicating the ship with the worse value in
that stat loses 1♥; other entries let you escape back to Travel phase.

**Planet phase** — At a planet, unless the GM says otherwise, you can
always pay 2¥ for 1♥, any number of times (and other bad exchange rates,
Catan-like).

**Encounters** — On each planet, the party engages in one Encounter. The
PCs always need or want something; GM secretly rolls the Contact's
disposition and need. After some ad libbed conversation, the GM will
offer two or three choices, like an encounter card in Scythe. There
will be a table of options for the GM to choose from. In initial
role-play the PCs can ask for particular options, or be more cagey.

Play until your ship is destroyed or you earn enough money to buy a
small moon and go legit.


## "Concerto"

Forbidden Island meets Scythe. You are agents provocatuer,
planet-hopping to build and coordinate the revolution.

In the center of the table are several planets; each player has a pawn
on a planet, but also action boards like Scythe. Turns are simultaneous.
Play is silent. Reading notes on your current planet, and leaving a note
yourself, is one of the actions you can take for your turn. Having a
Scythe-like Encounter is an action; different player types can have
different kinds of encounter. War is an action, but you only get to
fully score planets that went to war on the same turn.

Maybe: Each planet has a bag of risk tokens, like Clank; in an Encounter
you can choose to take a risk and draw from the bag. Draw bad and the
empire cracks down and siezes all your stuff on that planet. Lose 3
planets and you lose the game.


## "Posthuman"

You are a reading group of the far future, meeting to discuss an
anthology you have all read of ancient works celebrating humanity.
It was not a crowd-pleaser.

To start, a player (anyone can start) chooses any IRL work of fiction or
nonfiction. Without naming it or giving away when it was written, they
describe it in some detail, and what aspect of humanity it portrays. If
any other player can guess the work, both players get a point. If not,
reveal the title. (In any case, make sure it's described in enough detail
that everyone can participate in the next phase, even if they haven't
read or seen the work.)

Then other players point out ways that this work failed to resonate with
them, due to some departure from humanity unanticipated by the
author. For example, if a player describes _Romeo and Juliet_, focusing
on the irresistability of young love, another player might reply that

-   soma is far more irresistable;
-   yearning comes with an off switch now;
-   the virus causing "love" was identified and eradicated centuries
    ago; or
-   love is passé, as there are far superior relationship modes now,
    like floop and snarzgoffling.

Stay on the theme(s) inintially suggested by the player who chose the
work, as long as you can; but discussion will inevitably turn to other
things in the work you can't relate to:

-   now that everyone's thoughts are involuntarily published on Twitter,
    misunderstandings like the one in _Romeo and Juliet_ are impossible;
-   the whole "death" concept sounds super problematic.

The player with the best observation (by general acclamation) gets two
points. Then move on to another work. Continue until everyone has
selected a work to discuss.

Most points wins.


## "Millenium" (or, Time Is Running Out)

Based on a John Varley story, I think _Millenium_ is the one; and the
games _Microscope_ by Ben Robbins and _Chrononauts_ by Looney Labs.

Start with a timeline (of 5 index cards, each one describing a
historical event in a fictional history) leading to an unacceptable
outcome: the Disaster. It can span millenia or just a few days. The
causal threads, though, must be clear.  Leave gaps in the story for key
events. These gaps are blind spots in history: points where no one knows
exactly what happened.

Discuss the timeline. Make sure everyone has a shared understanding of
the history. Players may also secretly think of possible plot twists,
characters, and interesting ways they might try changing the past
later. Some new information about the past should come up during this
phase. Add notes to the cards.

Start a one-hour timer.

You are time travelers. As a group, choose a gap in history and choose
which PCs to drop back into the past. (Or, players take turns choosing
these gaps.) Each gap can be chosen only once.

The chosen characters (the "drop team") are dropped right into the most
critical moment of action. There is no time to waste.

**Communication during scenes** — Characters not on the drop team can
observe the scene. They can speak to the drop team; no one else in the
past hears. (And typically the drop team would seem insane if they broke
character to talk back.)

**Scenes** — Characters from the past always act in order to keep the
story the same. Only time travelers can act in ways that would change
the past.

In each scene: (1) The team learns something. Maybe modern history got
the past wrong in important ways. Or maybe we just learn what happened
or why. (2) The drop team can change something. Changes follow the
causal threads forward in time and might contribute to averting the
disastrous outcome later. But if (3) the drop team changes events
dramatically, then there is a Rift.

**Rifts** — Significant changes will ripple forward in time. After each
scene, work forward in time and see if any later cards don't make sense
anymore, or events would have unfolded differently. Destroy those cards
and work together to replace them. You only need one Gap on these cards,
even if it replaces a card with two. Go fast. (The timer doesn't stop,
so Rifts take real-world time to heal.) It will usually turn out to be
the case that the changes did not avert the Disaster.

If a Rift wrecks the present, so that there are no people, or time
travel is never developed, the game ends and that timeline is final.

**The End** — When the timer goes off, if there's a Rift, finish healing
it; then whatever timeline you're left with is permanent.

Example timelines:

Disaster: A mutually destructive war.

1.  The nations of Scylla and Charybdis arise.
    - Scylla becomes a dictatorship.
    - Two queens meet and disagree.
2.  The invention of polyphemic technology.
    - A lone discovery.
    - A Charybdian drives to industrialization.
3.  The provocation.

Disaster: Supervillain hegemony.

1.  Origins.
2.  A technological discovery.
3.  Crimes.
4.  A superhero team mysteriously joins the supervillain's side.
5.  The world's governments are brought to heel.

Disaster: Bob is going to marry Lillian. (We're all meeting for his bachelor party.)

1.  Bob's back story
    - Bob is dumped by his ex, Clarisse.
    - He hits a low point in his life.
2.  Lillian's back story
    - Lillian is forged from pure evil-mantium in the pits of Hell.
    - Lillian is interested in this one guy, but comes on too strong.
3.  Early relationship
    - The meet-cute.
    - Lillian meets one of Bob's friends.
4.  They get serious.
    - They talk about what they want out of life.
    - Lillian reveals her True Form.
5.  Bob falls into Lillian's clutches.
    - Bob has a talk with a trusted friend, who later turns up dead, chewed by "feral dogs".
    - Bob proposes.


## Even vaguer ideas

### "Triptych"

There are three worlds, each with its own rules for conflict,
exploration, character development, the passage of time, and so on:

*   the material world
*   the spiritual world
*   the virtual world

Ideally the three rule sets would be developed by completely independent
groups and tied together in the nastiest possible way; adventures and
even key scenes could span all three worlds.


### Portal Kombat

I've been wanting for a while to do a combat system with regions instead
of a full map. It might make sense if the environment is really gadgety.
