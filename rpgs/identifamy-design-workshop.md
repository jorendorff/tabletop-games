# Adventures

## Northern Mountain

Winters have been growing colder. Northern villages have been
disappearing. There are rumors of awful monsters. Your brave band must
row far up the shrouded coast in your dragon-boat, fight walrusmen and
arctic spiders, trek over the ice on sleds, and confront a yeti sorcerer
in his cave.

Viking-esque, but in a world where they live alongside, and mingle with,
vastly different cultures and races, like the Mediterranean. The Vikings
don't care about technology unless it relates directly to survival or
war. And the cold does much of their fighting for them.

Maybe the Vikings' attitude is, if those villages didn't want to
disappear, they should have been stronger--but if you island folk wish
to seek glory in the icy North, be our guest. We hope you are strong.

The King takes a different view, and wants the threat confronted and
rooted out.

Scene summary: the Prince's halls; walrusfolk; flashbacks. Spiders;
disaster; flashbacks. Yeti battle.

Now this is overprepared, brittle.

Idea: what if I tried spinning the whole story after character
generation is over, and letting one pair tell their story right at the
beginning, a flashback to kick it off? Plenty movies start that way.

*   Scene 1: meeting the Nordling Prince in his halls in Lowenheim.  He
    may equip you (you people do not dress warmly enough); send sleds
    and dogs; send warriors; tell you what he knows. He believes the
    disappearances are due to hard weather and weakness, but there are
    those who say some evil is at work, monsters, and that the source is
    a wicked magician, a scourge sent by the elder gods.

    (if sending warriors) "Some even say he is fated to meet me
    (i.e. the Prince of the Nordlings) in battle: a titan, a scourge of
    the gods against a man. If there is such a one, tell him I am here."

*   Scene 2: sailing, then rowing north. a destroyed town. runes of ill
    omen. Bickering over whether this means anything. Attacked at
    twilight by walrusfolk. (The Nordlings say they are good eating.)
    Storm forces you to pitch tents. After much trying, a fire.

*   Flashbacks 1 and 2.

*   Scene 3: sledding over ice, ascending into rocky hills. out of a
    chasm pour arctic spiders.

*   Scene 4: supplies lost. what to do? no choice but to go forward. a
    night on the ice.

*   Flashbacks 3 and 4. (or consider moving all four flashbacks here)

*   Scene 5: Yeti mountain. Conversation fails. Volcanic activity.
    Avalanche. Ranged combat, with spiders applying pressure and keeping
    the melee folks busy.

*   Scene 6: Up the stair, volcano lair. Yeti calls on the elder
    gods. They send an eruption, lava streaking the ice. Nearby ice
    becomes slippery. Yeti a h*ckin force in melee, and practically
    invisible when snow blows every direction. Maybe, yeti sin revealed;
    or an appeal to the elder gods to allow a fair fight. The snow
    calms. But the elder gods give the yeti a massive sword of
    black ice, harder than steel.

    Yeti thought himself invincible, fated to meet the Prince in
    battle. Unknown to anyone present, one of the Nordlings fighting
    with the party has become Prince by the death of the Prince in
    Lowenheim.
