# My Spell

## Artifacts

(once a day really isn't fun in EARS)

A wand of the wizard Walleri, that gives you a W any time.

A cursed amulet. You can take 1 damage to use the first letter of your name.

A potion. Before drawing tiles, quaff it to draw 3 extra tiles.

Forked pendant. Turns any letter tile into a double letter tile: O ->
OO, or Z -> ZZ. The doubled letters can't be split up; you have to use
them together (you can make BOOTS with your OO tile, but not an OBOE).

## Effect sizes

Summoning:

-   an everyday item: L1

-   a weapon or other very specialized item, possibly powerful in the right hands: L2

-   anything very large: +1

-   anything magical: +1 or more if the effect is major; no penalty
    otherwise. The penalty is deliberately small since almost everything
    you do is going to be pretty wild, and magic items (JET CAPE)
    usually require two words, a ton of letters.

-   permanence - anything that lasts longer than the amount of time
    you'd normally use it: +1; but if it's magical or disruptive, +2 or
    +3.
