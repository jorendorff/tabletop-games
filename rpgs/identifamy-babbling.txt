    an escape
    arrests and recriminations
    breakdown
    explosive tempers
    fraud and betrayal
    nervous
    prima donna fit
    substance abuse
    divine intervention
    frayed nerves

end_event ::
    you got sloppy
    you got caught
    the secret got out
    you quarreled over money
    you quarreled over a love interest
    you almost got caught and had to go on the run
    one betrayed the other
    you were both betrayed
    one went legit
    you were muscled out by the thieves' guild
    you were acqui-hired by the thieves' guild
    you looked up and realized it was a giant headache
    you suddenly had to flee for your lives
    an associate siezed control
    one of you got religion
    the bosses quarreled
    the mayor stepped in
    you realized you had different, irreconcilable goals
