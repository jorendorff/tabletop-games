# Identifamy, the mystery competitive role-playing game

(player's guide)


The five phases of Identifamy:

-   **Identity** - Find out who you are and why.

-   **Adventure** - Go on an adventure with your friends and find out who *they* are.

-   **Storytelling** - Tell your own story in flashbacks.

-   **Drawing** - Make your own picture of the team.

-   **Scoring** - Get points, not for artistic skill,
    but for how well you've gotten to know each other.

How does it work? Your character's identity is made up of ten secret
**trait cards**, and you reveal those traits during gameplay not by
telling the other players about them, but by role-playing them.

After your adventure, you sketch your teammates, trying to include
everything you know about them. Finally, the cards are revealed, and you
get points for what you got right about the other players in your
drawingâ€”and what their pictures got right about you.
