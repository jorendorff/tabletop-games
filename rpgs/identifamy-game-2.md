## Back stories

### Proposed

Teddy dropped out, what was actually offered turned out to be a bit of a
mess. All pairs ultimately picked a bond I wrote for them.

-   Abby-Meg:

    *   siblings, older one constantly getting the mischievous,
        impulsive younger one out of scrapes and even serious dangers

    *   served as marines on a ship sent to explore a distant continent.
        You were the only two marines. They should have sent more.

-   Meg-James:

    *   sole survivors of a village wiped out by (plague / *[choose
        natural disaster: ants]*). (How did you live afterwards?)

    *   marooned on the same island in separate incidents *[choose time
        span: 2 months]* apart, met there, and teamed up to get home


-   James-Teddy:

    *   orphans raised by the same (religious order /
        *[choose job: woodcutter]* / cottage-dwelling gnome family /
        child-eating witch / dismal orphanage / wolfpack)

    *   volunteer firefighters in a farm community when it fell on hard
        times and there were suddenly lots of fires, dangerous ones
        (why?)

-   Teddy-Abby:

    *   guarded a caravan bringing salt and other essentials over the
        desert to a creepy (zealot settlement / cloister / mine / ghost
        town). The same hard route, back and forth, for four eventful
        years.

    *   had a two-person *[choose performance: penguin-juggling]* act in
        the circus. It fell apart due to (fraud and betrayal / an escape
        / a revolt / substance abuse / prima donna fit / nervous
        breakdown / explosive tempers / a riot / arrests and
        recriminations)


### Actual

Abby and Meg: siblings, the older one constantly getting the
mischievous, impulsive younger one out of scrapesâ€”and even serious
dangers. Meg is three years older.

-   begin: birth

-   middle: lots of stories, exasperation

-   end: the younger one (Abby) runs away (with an elephant, but Meg doesn't
    know)

-   feels: (A says) she's annoying, overbearing, kind of cool
    though. dependable. (M says) kind of annoying, gets in scrapes,
    sometimes mad at her

James and Abby: had a two person elephant-taming act in the circus. It
fell apart when they staged an escape, taking the elephant with them,
pursued by angry circus folk.

-   begin: they met one season, talked a lot about running away, really
    did it the next season

-   middle: on the run

-   end: found someone to take the poor malnourished elephant off their
    hands, after that, drifted apart

-   feels: (A says) kind of uncly, semi-trust

Meg and James: members of an expedition to capture a breeding pair of an
endangered species of anteater. They traveled a long time, to a wild
place, and faced tornadoes, ostriches, and poachers. The expedition was
a success. They took the anteaters to the royal wildlife reserve and
saved the species.

-   begin: met for the expedition

-   middle: an adventure

-   end: had planned to do something together after, but Meg got a
    mysterious letter and left

-   feels: (J says) mad, disappointed, (M says) sad, liked him, friends

> This took a long time. It has to be tightened up; less writing
> round-trips; the players need to drive more. We could play the game
> like this instead:
>
> 1.  Each player is dealt a ton of random trait cards; they are
>     numbered so that #1 is always Visual, #10 tends to be a Carryall,
>     and in between it varies but there's only one number that's ever a
>     Pet. Each player picks a "run" of cards 1-10.
>
> 2.  Each bond-pair is dealt two cards each of
>
>     - "it began when..."
>     - "what it was like..."
>     - "it ended when..."
>     - "how we feel now"
>
>     From this they construct their back story. Throughout this phase
>     they're free to revisit decisions they made in step 1.
>
> I noticed the players all struggled with the "how do you feel now?"
> question. They are just too young. Though our own relationships are
> complicated enough.
