## Ideas

What if you could Jumpstart™ a character by picking two index cards that
have playbooks on them? No stats. Magic in every playbook.

What if when you learned a spell, you rolled for how effective it was,
and you could level that number up later? What if you could level up
every spell by tweaking any number in the description?

What if you could make your own spells, but there are just world rules
that keep magic from being too crazy? Like for example, all spells might
be touch range only, or only work if no one else notices right away (I
think there was a LARP where you'd take massive damage if people saw
your magic and were astounded—good mechanic). You might word your spell,
then research it, and the GM would tell you what glyphs you need to
research to make this spell, and how to do that.

## Effect sizes

A table of magical effects that tells you how big they are.

A logarithmic scale might be good. It's weird that spells in D&D tend to
scale linearly, but then at 8th level you're casting *earthquake*. You
could not generate an effect 1/8 the scale at level 1.

Maybe +2 should double the magnitude of the effect, and each effect can
say which things scale: typically things like area of effect (requires
+4 or +6 if 2d or 3d area), amount of damage, range, number of people or
hit points of people affected.

Blades in the Dark has some tables under (inexplicably) Downtime → Magnitude.

It's for supernatural stuff. You make a fortune roll, using the
mangitude of the ghost or demon or whatever as the dice pool.  I'm not
crazy about this; it's not meant to be especially bulletproof, for one
thing. Might be a starting place though.

|Aspect      |             0 |                  1 |                  2 |                 3 |                   4 |                   5 |                     6 |
|Area        | A closet      | A small room       | A large room       | Several rooms     | A small building    | A large building    | A city block          |
|Scale       | 1 or 2 people | A small gang (3-6) | A medium gang (12) | A large gang (20) | A huge gang (40)    | A massive gang (80) | A colossal gang (160) |
|Duration    | A few moments | A few minutes      | An hour            | A few hours       | A day               | Several days        | A week                |
|Range       | Within reach  | A dozen paces      | A stone's throw    | Down the road     | Several blocks away | Across the district | Across the city       |
|Tier/Quality| Poor          | Adequate           | Good               | Excellent         | Superior            | Impeccable          | Legendary             |
|Force       | Weak          | Moderate           | Strong             | Serious           | Powerful            | Overwhelming        | Devastating           |


Note that Blades gets away with "limited", "standard", and "great".


## Content generator

A roadmap for a program that generates characters.

1.  Make a huge list of traits and pick seven to ten.

2.  Support traits with variation like "(long / short) (black / red / blond / blue) hair".

3.  Support traits with variation like "*[choose monster]*-leather boots".

4.  Tag traits with attributes ("sea", "fantasy", "pirate") and select clusters by attribute.

5.  Tag attributes with attributes. ("pirate: sea")

6.  Relate opposed attributes ("opposed(folksy, royal)"). Create
    characters that have opposition of one particular type in them, but
    otherwise avoid it.

7.  Tag traits with power levels and try to balance. Maybe this means
    creating a character at random and then swapping out unbalanced
    traits: program needs to be able to fill in a partial character.

8.  Front-end for the whole thing that lets you say in natural language
    what kind of character you want ("sinister pirate with a pet").
    Try to understand synonyms.

9.  Front-end that prints trait-sets as sentences.


## Notes on Blades in the Dark (BitD)

Man, the core mechanic is pretty complicated.

- action
- position & effect
- bonuses
- roll

The effect level is set by the GM, not by your level of ambition. It
doesn't affect your chances of success. It just tells you how much you
can hope to accomplish if you roll a 6.

Your position (controlled, risky, or desperate) does not affect your
chances of success. (Good for narrative.) It only affects the
consequences imposed if you don't roll a 6. (Also good for narrative.)

In short, effect level affects upside; position affects downside.

NPCs do not roll.
