# Star Collector

This is a very simple card game for two players. The object is to
collect the most stars.

Each card has three things on it:

*   In the middle of the card, one or more stars.

*   At the top of the card, the word "fight" and a number from 1 to 6.

*   At the bottom of the card, upside-down, the word "draw" and a number
    from 1 to 6.

When you hold a card from the bottom, your thumb covers the "draw" part,
so only the "fight" side shows. Or, if you turn it the other way up, your
thumb covers the "fight" part and the "draw" side is visible.

The back of the cards is symmetrical so you can't tell, by looking at
the back of a card your opponent is holding, whether they're holding the
"fight" side or the "draw" side up.

----

To start, shuffle the deck and deal each player three cards.

Each turn, both players choose a card from their hand and choose which
side to play. To play the "fight" side, simply hold the card with that
side up, your thumb covering the word "draw".

Players simultaneously reveal their cards.

**If either player chose "draw",** then they draw the number of cards
indicated on their chosen card (so if you played a "Draw 3" card, draw
three cards). But don't draw up to more than seven (???) cards in hand.
The "draw" card is put into the discard pile.

**If both players chose to "draw",** the player who played the higher
draw number draws first. This only matters if there aren't enough cards
left in the deck for both players to draw.

**If one player chose "fight",** that player collects the card they
played. (The other player, who chose "draw", draws cards as described above.
Their "draw" card is discarded, not collected.)

**If both players chose "fight",** then the player who played the higher
fight number collects both cards. In case of a tie, leave both cards on
the table until someone plays a "fight" card and either wins the fight
or wins by default (because the other player played a "draw" card). That
player collects the tied cards. (If that never happens before the game
ends, nobody collects those cards.)

A few cards have special rules on one side, either instructions to
follow when you play that side of the card (like, "fight 3 and draw a
card") or some special rule about how that card works (like, "fight 1
but this card beats 'fight 6' cards").

Repeat until someone has no cards in hand at the end of the turn.

----

When a player runs out of cards in hand, if there are still any cards in
the deck, that player loses the game. Otherwise, the other player
discards their hand and whoever collected the most stars wins.

(XXX Not sure this is the right endgame criterion; game should maybe end
as soon as the deck is empty.)


## Why is this game good?

It's short and quick.

It's about the tradeoff between spending down your reserves (that is,
your hand) to gain victory points, and investing in the future in a very
clear, raw, elemental way.

It's simple; each card has just three numbers on it basically, yet the
strategy is pretty rich. There's a bit of a bluffing element that makes
for satisfying wins.

I've never seen anyone get such a dominant lead that the other player is
really out of it at the end.

When your hand gets small, your opponent knows you'll eventually have to
draw. If they know you're going to draw, they can win with a weak
"fight" card that has lots of stars on it. (This brings to mind the
paradox of the hanged man.) Likewise, when your hand is full, your
opponent knows you'll probably fight (since drawing on a full hand is a
waste).

Toward the end, there's strategy in choosing when the game ends. If
you're ahead, you can play a big "draw" to try and empty the deck. But
this can backfire.
