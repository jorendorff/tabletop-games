# Who Am I?

A curiosity for five players

## Setup

This is a card game that teaches you how to play it as you go.

Setup: Each player gets a deck of cards. There are five decks, all
different, arranged in advance.

Players must not shuffle their deck or look at the cards.

To begin the game, each player draws the top card of their deck
and follows the instructions on it.


## Ideas

* the cards tell you the rules
* the first cards just say "i can't remember who i am"
* a character could be composed of two different decks, interleaved.
  for example, there could be "even" decks and "odd" decks, and a character
  might be "red-blue" or "gray-green" meaning you take all the red cards and all the blue cards,
  or all the gray and green, and together they make a full deck.

* at end of game, final cards should tell you how to reset for the next player
    * (and maybe it should tell you to write a note to the next player
        who plays your character, any three words, and slip it under the
        top card of the deck)


Possible mechanics:

*   **Exploration** - There could be a separate deck of locations. You
    could choose to go exploring and add to the map.

*   **Actions** - Each turn, each player may choose one *action*
    from among the available actions. Or you can do nothing, no big deal.

*   **Monsters** - Some cards are monster cards. If there are ever (say)
    seven monsters, the players all lose the game.

Twists:

* one player turns out to be a monster
* some cards must be kept secret; one player holds powerful secrets all game
* one player's secret is "at the end of the game, if you've chosen the last option on more than one **Choice**, you lose the game, even if everyone else wins".
* players build a map together
* players "explore", gathering more map pieces
* game elements added gradually


Card types:

*   Any card can have plain text on it; that's basically just flavor text.

*   At the top of every card is either a "reveal" icon or a "secret" icon.

    The rule might be: you're not allowed to reveal a secret card,
    or tell anyone *anything* about what's on it,
    until it says to reveal it.

    Secret cards might tell you about your character.
    For example, a card might say, "Conscience -- At the end of the game,
    if you have killed another character, you lose."

*   Some cards have a **Rule** box that teaches you a rule of the game.
    (These cards would normally be "reveal" cards, but secret rules are possible too;
    see "Conscience" example above.)

*   Some cards offer you a **Choice**, like the encounter cards in Scythe.
    These will start out being one-per-turn,

*   Some cards have a picture of a place. The players can use them to make a map.
