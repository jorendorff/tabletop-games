## A Game of Cipher

### Damage cards

Computer — The ship's cortex has been configured to an extreme level of distrust. With your memory in shreds, convincing it of your identity is a difficult chore.

Computer — Hundreds of sentient computer tasks are elaborately calculating pi, draining the ship's power. They fight your efforts, but at last you terminate them all.

Engineering — The engine's quantum regulator has been completely fused using a plasma torch. Fortunately there is another one in the ship's stores.

Systems — Someone has set the oxygen mix to dangerously high levels. Bringing them back down is easy, so you spend some extra time secretly setting alarms, in case it happens again.

Systems — The main electric exchange has been blasted with a laser rifle. It takes hours to jury-rig the basics back together. There's no time for the rest.

Systems — Sensors have not been working due to miscalibrated lens apertures. It's hard to fix, and harder to tell if the error was deliberate.






### Red's memories

The engine room went dark just before you blacked out.

The warp engine equations are fixed in your memory, burning bright like stars. In Engineering puzzles, you know that C = Q. (Do not tell other players this.)

The officer in Blue gave everyone a pep talk before the ship entered the positron field. Blue is not the imposter.
